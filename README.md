# Snake_Game

Snake Game Using python
=================

This is a classic Snake Game implemented using the Python turtle module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen and tries to eat fruits to score points. The snake grows longer as it eats more fruits, making the game more challenging.

Instructions
------------
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
- The snake can move up, down, left, or right, but cannot move in the opposite direction of its current movement.
- The objective is to eat as many fruits as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake's own body.
- The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries or collides with itself.
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen, and it increases by one each time the snake eats a fruit.
- The game speed increases gradually as the score increases.

This game requires the `turtle` module, which is a part of the standard Python library. No additional installations are necessary.
