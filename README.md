## Features

- Smooth snake movement controlled by arrow keys
- Randomly generated food for the snake to eat
- Increasing length of the snake as it eats food
- Game over when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself
- High score tracking and display
- Option to play again after game over

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
